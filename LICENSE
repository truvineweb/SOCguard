# Why Python?

- Mature libraries for **WinRM** (`pypsrp`) and **SSH/SFTP** (`paramiko`)
- Easy to package for Kali (pipx / .deb)
- Clean CLI with no runtime compilation

---

# Best practices applied

- **TLS validation on by default** (WinRM)  
- **SSH keys recommended**; host key policy configurable (reject/warning/autoadd)  
- **No password echo** (prompts when omitted)  
- **Chunked downloads over WinRM** to avoid envelope size limits  
- **Clear exit codes** (0 = success, 2 = hash mismatch)  
- **Separation of concerns** (connector modules, core orchestration, utils)

# Quickstart Recap
